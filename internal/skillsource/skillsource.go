// Package skillsource resolves skill source directories. Discovery is
// HARNESS-SCOPED: the active harness (config.Harness) determines which skills
// roots omac scans. Each harness owns a skills base — OpenCode owns "opencode"
// (.opencode/skills), Claude Code owns "claude" (.claude/skills) — matching
// where that harness's own loader reads SKILL.md. A shared neutral base,
// "agents" (.agents/skills), is in scope for every harness. omac NEVER scans
// another harness's base, so a skill that belongs to the inactive harness is
// invisible to the active run.
//
// For the OpenCode harness, lookup order is:
//
//	workdir-local:
//	  1. <workdir>/.opencode/skills/X   (own base)
//	  2. <workdir>/.agents/skills/X     (shared base)
//
//	user-global (only roots that exist on disk are scanned):
//	  3. $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/skills/X, $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/agents/skills/X
//	  4. $HOME/.config/opencode/skills/X,    $HOME/.config/agents/skills/X
//	  5. $HOME/.opencode/skills/X,           $HOME/.agents/skills/X
//
// For the Claude Code harness, substitute "claude" for "opencode" above; the
// "opencode" roots are NOT scanned, and vice versa.
//
// The harness's own base ranks above the shared `agents` base in every layer,
// so a harness-specific skill overrides a neutral one of the same name.
// Workdir-local always wins over user-global on name collision.
//
// What omac considers a "skill" is the same across every root: a directory
// containing an `omac.yaml` at its top level. A directory with only a
// `SKILL.md` is a valid agentskills.io skill but does not have an omac sidecar
// contract, so omac ignores it (no registration, no spawning).
//
// Registration data follows the source layer. A skill resolved from
// a workdir-local source records its registry entry and config in
// that workdir (.opencode/sidecar.json, .opencode/skill-config.yaml).
// A skill resolved from a user-global source records its registry
// entry and config once, globally (~/.config/omac/sidecar.json,
// ~/.config/omac/skill-config.yaml — XDG_CONFIG_HOME honored), so a
// single `omac register <name>` makes it available in every workdir.
// Keychain secrets are keyed by skill name and are therefore already
// global. When both layers hold state for the same skill name, the
// workdir layer wins.
